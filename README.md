### Installing process using CLI
The installation of Ironchip Windows using commands (cmd) with the program "msiexec.exe." Hereâ€™s a basic tutorial on how to do it:

1) Open the command line (cmd):
    - Press Win + R to open the "Run" dialog.
    - Type "cmd" and press Enter.
2) Locate the MSI file:
    - Make sure you have the MSI file you want to install in an accessible location from the command line.
3) Execute the msiexec command:
    - The basic command to install an MSI file is as follows:

    ```bash
    msiexec.exe /i Path\To\IronchipWindowsLogon.msi /q
    ```

    Replace "Path\To\IronchipWindowsLogon.msi" with the full path and name of the MSI file. The APIKEY will only be necessary if you want to install the Windows Logon functionality, which can be obtained through the following procedure:
    https://docs.ironchip.com/en/windows-logon

    Additionally, if you want a more customized installation, the installer has optional parameters:
    - Customization of the environment -> To do this, the IRONCHIP_HOST property is used to customize the environment you want to target (by default "https://api.ironchip.com").
    - Customization of the features to install -> To do this, the ADDLOCAL property is used to customize the functionalities you want to install. In this case, we have several options (LogonFeature, OfflineFeature, AuthenticatorFeature, USBFeature, CachedPasswordsFeature) that can be combined.

    Example 1: Installation of the desktop application functionality and USB functionality
    ```bash
    msiexec.exe /i IronchipWindowsLogon.msi  IRONCHIP_HOST="https://api.ironchip.com" ADDLOCAL="AuthenticatorFeature,USBFeature" /q
    ```

    Example 2: Installation of the desktop application functionality without the USB functionality
    ```bash
    msiexec.exe /i IronchipWindowsLogon.msi IRONCHIP_HOST="https://api.ironchip.com" ADDLOCAL="AuthenticatorFeature" /q
    ```

    - Proxy configuration -> This configuration is only necessary if you want to enable it, as it is disabled by default. We have disabled, automatic, and manual modes, and for this, several properties are configured:

        - IRONCHIP_PROXY_SELECTED -> This property is used to set the proxy status: none, automatic, or manual.
        - IRONCHIP_PROXY_MANUAL_HOST -> Only necessary if enabling the proxy manually.
        - IRONCHIP_PROXY_MANUAL_PORT -> Only necessary if enabling the proxy manually.

    Example 1: Automatic proxy configuration
    ```bash
    msiexec.exe /i IronchipWindowsLogon.msi  IRONCHIP_HOST="https://api.ironchip.com" IRONCHIP_PROXY_SELECTED="automatic" /q
    ```

    Example 2: Manual proxy configuration
    ```bash
    IRONCHIP_HOST="https://api.ironchip.com" 
    IRONCHIP_PROXY_SELECTED="manual" IRONCHIP_PROXY_MANUAL_HOST="localhost" IRONCHIP_PROXY_MANUAL_PORT="8080" /q
    ```
4) Wait for it to finish:
    - The installation process may take some time. Stay in the command line until you see the prompt indicating that the installation is complete.
