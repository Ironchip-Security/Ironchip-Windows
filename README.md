## Repository Deprecation

We have split the original installer (MSI) into two separate installers, each dedicated to a specific feature:  

- [**Ironchip Windows Authenticator**](https://github.com/Ironchip-Security/Ironchip-Windows-Authenticator)  
- [**Ironchip Windows Logon**](https://github.com/Ironchip-Security/Ironchip-Windows-Logon)  

### Important changes

- **Windows Logon** now has a **unique installation GUID**, meaning no data from previous Logon versions will be transferred to the new installation.  

- **Windows Authenticator** keeps the **same GUID**, so all existing application data will be preserved. However, **make sure to remove the Logon configuration before updating**, as the Logon feature will be removed during the update process.

### Revert disable default credential provider

In order to revert to force user to use **Ironchip Credential Provider**, the default **Windows Credential Provider** must be enabled again.

> The paths may vary depending on the language
#### Steps:
- Use the key shortcut `âŠž Win` + `R` and paste `gpedit.msc`

</p>

- Then inside the **Local Group Policy Editor** go to `Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Logon > Exclude Credential Providers`

- Set to **Disabled** or **Not Configured** the exclusion rule and remove the GUID of the Windows Password Credential Provider from the field. Then press apply.
